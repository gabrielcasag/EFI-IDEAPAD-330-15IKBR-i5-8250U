# EFI-IDEAPAD-330-15IKB-OPENCORE

## Intro

:warning: **This is not a guide**, please refer to [Dortania](https://dortania.github.io/getting-started) before doing anything. I am not responsible for any damage. This OpenCore configuration is optimized for my specific hardware, so please use it only as a reference or if you happen to have the same or similar hardware.

:information_source: **The current version is fully macOS compatible based on my laptop hardware.**
OpenCore, drivers, and kexts are always up to date!

:information_source: This efi has a hybrid configuration, which means that some kexts are dynamically loaded depending on the macOS (kernel) version. So you can choose the macOS version and use the same EFI.

:information_source: The EFI's have been tested on Catalina, BigSur, Moneterey, Ventura and Sonoma on my IDEAPAD 330 15IKB.

## :white_check_mark: Working

- [x] CPU power management.
- [x] Graphics acceleration.
- [x] Battery read-out.
- [x] Keyboard & trackpad with all macOS gestures.
- [x] Wi-Fi.
- [x] Bluetooth.
- [x] USB ports.
- [x] HDMI video & audio output.
- [x] Ethernet.

- [x] iMessage & FaceTime.

## :x: Not working

Only AirDrop and Handoff are not working since the Intel card are not fully compatible with macOS. To make these things works you need to replace with a native card one, like the Fenvi cards.

## :closed_lock_with_key: SMBIOS

You will need to generate your own SMBIOS and configure, since is required to fully work with macOS. As per this [guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/config-laptop.plist/kaby-lake.html#platforminfo) you can use the following SMBIOS: MacbookPro14,1.

Since the launch of Ventura, I've started using SMBIOS on the MacbookPro15.4 due to its better compatibility compared to the MacbookPro14.1. Another option you could try is MacbookPro15,2.

It's fully **required** to generate your own serials with [GenSMBIOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS) and put it in your config.plist.

- Config.plist -> PlatformInfo -> Generic

## BIOS setup

- Security / Intel Platform Trust Technology - Disabled
- Security / Intel SGX - Disabled
- Security / Secure Boot - Disabled
- Boot / Boot Mode - UEFI

## Steps

1. [Download](https://github.com/gabrielcasag/EFI-IDEAPAD-330-15IKBR-i5-8250U/releases/latest) the latest release;
2. Generate your SMBIOS infos with GenSMBIOS and put on the config.plist;
3. Put the EFI folder on a USB drive with the macOS recovery image or offline image;
4. Install macOS and enjoy :)
